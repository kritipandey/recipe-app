<ol>
    <li>Add A button which says 'Display Details'</li>
    <li>Add a paragraph with any content of your choice (e.g. 'Secret Password = tuna')</li>
    <li>Toggle the displaying of that paragraph with the button created in the first step</li>
    <li>Log all button clicks in an array and output that array below the secret paragraph (maybe log a timestamp or simply an incrementing number)</li>
    <li>Starting at the 5th log item, give all future log items a blue background (via ngStyle) and white color (ngClass)</li>
</ol>

<!-- <button class='btn btn-primary' (click)="showSecretText = !showSecretText">Display Details</button> -->
<button class='btn btn-primary' (click)='onLoggingDetails()'>Display Details</button>
<p *ngIf="showSecretText">Secret Password = tuna</p>
<p *ngFor='let logItem of log; let i = index'   
[ngStyle] = "{backgroundColor: i >= 4? 'blue':'transparent'}"
[ngClass] = "{logColor : i >= 4}">{{ logItem }}</p>



<!-- we have defined "let i = index" because without it, the "new Date()" timestamp result is a string 
     and string is always greater than 5 due to which background color condition was not satisfied and
     was blue from the starting-->
